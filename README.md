# dosimetry
a simple monta carlo simulation for a perfect detector from an isotropic source and an infinetly large carbon absorber inbetween.
The programm generates an energy spectra and a local resolution of the events on the detector. The detector can be shifted and 
the thicknes of the absorber can be changed. 

#Dependencies
  python 3.9.13
  pandas 1.4.4
  numpy 1.21.5
  matplotlib 3.5.2


  Do not take a thickness of 1cm else the program will crash.
